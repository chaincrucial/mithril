# User Manual

Welcome to the **Mithril** user manual!

Let's discover **Mithril in less than 5 minutes**.

## Introduction

A **Mithril Network** is composed of 3 main components:

* **Mithril Aggregator**:

This node is in charge of **coordinating the production of the Cardano snapshot archives** (along with the associated certificates powered by Mithril multi signatures) by interacting with Mithril Signer nodes and a Cardano node.

* **Mithril Signer**:

This node is in charge of **producing single signatures that are then combined into a multi signature** by the Mithril Aggregator. It works side by side with a Cardano node that has stakes in the network (Stake Pool Operator or SPO).

* **Mithril Client**:

This node is in charge of **verifying and restoring a snapshot** that will allow a lightning fast boostrapping of a Cardano full node.
