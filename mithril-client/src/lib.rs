//! Define everything necessary to list, download, and validate snapshots from a

//!
//! To query an aggregator for snapshots & certificate use the [AggregatorHTTPClient] that implement

//!
//! To verify a multi-signature use the `VerifierImpl` that implement the `Verifier` trait.
//!
//! To list, download, and validate snapshots use the [Runtime].
//! You must initialize it by giving it a `Verifier`, a [AggregatorHandler], and a
//! [Digester](https://mithril.network/mithril-common/doc/mithril_common/digesters/trait.Digester.html)
//! implementations using the `with_xxx` methods.
